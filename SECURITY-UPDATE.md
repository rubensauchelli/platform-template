# Security Update: Next.js CVE-2025-29927

## Update Summary

- **Date of Update**: April 04, 2025
- **Next.js Version Before**: 14.2.23
- **Next.js Version After**: 15.2.4
- **Related Packages Updated**: eslint-config-next to 15.2.4

## Vulnerability Details

This update addresses the CVE-2025-29927 vulnerability in Next.js that affected self-hosted deployments using `next start` and `output: 'standalone'`.

### Vulnerability Description

The vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass middleware functionality by manipulating HTTP headers, potentially skipping critical security checks such as authorization cookie validation before reaching routes. This could lead to unauthorized access to protected resources and routes.

### Impact

Applications using middleware for security-critical functions like authentication validation were most at risk. This update ensures that middleware properly validates all requests before they reach the application routes.

## Changes Made

1. Updated Next.js from version 14.2.23 to 15.2.4
2. Updated eslint-config-next to match the new Next.js version
3. Documented the security fix

## Next Steps

Before deploying to production, we should:

1. Fix the current build errors related to missing components
2. Conduct thorough testing of all middleware functionality
3. Verify that all authentication and authorization flows work correctly
4. Test protected routes to ensure they require proper authentication

## Additional Security Considerations

Since this project relies on middleware for security, we should:

1. Add additional security checks beyond middleware when possible
2. Implement input validation at multiple layers
3. Apply the principle of defense in depth
4. Never trust user-controlled input, including HTTP headers
