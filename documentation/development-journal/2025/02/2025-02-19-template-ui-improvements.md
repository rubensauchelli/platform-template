# Template UI and Model Sync Improvements

## Overview
Following yesterday's work on model synchronization improvements, today's focus was on enhancing the template management UI and fixing API response handling issues. These changes are part of our ongoing effort to improve the application's user experience and code reliability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Template Management Improvements
- Fixed template edit functionality to properly handle wrapped API responses
- Updated `loadTemplate` and `handleSubmit` functions to correctly process API response structure
- Added consistent header with breadcrumb navigation to the templates page
- Implemented proper layout structure with sidebar trigger and content overflow handling

### 2. Model Sync Enhancements (Previous Day)
- Improved search layout with stacked filters for better organization
- Enhanced UI with subtle button states and better badge styling
- Added loading states and optimized delete flow
- Fixed type errors and deprecated fields
- Improved response handling for better reliability

## Technical Details

### API Response Handling
The template edit page now properly handles the standardized API response format:
```typescript
{
    success: true,
    data: {
        id: string;
        title: string;
        description: string;
        instructions: string;
        model: string;
        temperature: number;
        isDefault: boolean;
        assistantType: string;
        createdAt: string;
        updatedAt: string;
    }
}
```

### UI Components
Added consistent header structure:
```tsx
<header className="flex h-16 shrink-0 items-center gap-2 transition-[width,height] ease-linear group-has-[[data-collapsible=icon]]/sidebar-wrapper:h-12">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 px-4">
    <SidebarTrigger className="-ml-1" />
    <Breadcrumb>
      <BreadcrumbList>
        <BreadcrumbItem>
          <BreadcrumbPage>AI Templates</BreadcrumbPage>
        </BreadcrumbItem>
      </BreadcrumbList>
    </Breadcrumb>
  </div>
</header>
```

## Impact
- Improved user experience with consistent navigation and better UI feedback
- Fixed template editing functionality, ensuring proper data handling
- Enhanced UI consistency with standardized header and breadcrumb navigation
- Optimized model synchronization workflow with better error handling and loading states

## Next Steps
- Consider adding loading states for template operations
- Implement error boundaries for better error handling
- Add success/error notifications for template operations
- Consider adding template preview functionality
- Explore potential performance optimizations for model sync operations
