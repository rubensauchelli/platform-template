# Static Export Optimization and API Route Configuration
**Date**: February 26, 2025

## Overview
Today we focused on resolving issues with Next.js static exports and improving UI consistency across the application. We addressed specific problems with API routes and enhanced the templates page layout.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. API Route Dynamic Configuration
- Fixed "Dynamic server usage" errors during static export for specific API routes
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to problematic routes:
  - `/api/users/templates/defaults`
  - `/api/templates/selections`
- Identified that Clerk authentication was causing headers usage in these routes
- Implemented a consistent approach that can be applied to other routes if needed

### 2. HTTP Status Standardization
- Updated API routes to use consistent `HTTP_STATUS` constants
- Replaced hardcoded status codes with named constants
- Ensured consistent error response formatting
- Fixed a type error with `HTTP_STATUS.BAD_REQUEST` by using the correct constant

### 3. UI Layout Improvements
- Fixed centering issues on the templates page
- Adjusted container classes for proper alignment
- Changed from nested containers to a single container with proper max-width
- Improved layout consistency with other pages in the application

## Technical Implementation

The API route configuration pattern we implemented:
```typescript
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { ErrorCode, HTTP_STATUS } from '@/types/api'

// Explicitly mark this route as dynamic
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

export async function GET() {
  // Route implementation
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true, data: result }, { status: HTTP_STATUS.SUCCESS })
}
```

## Lessons Learned
- Next.js route segment config is essential for controlling static vs. dynamic behavior
- API routes using authentication often need special handling during static export
- Consistent container patterns are important for UI alignment
- Using standardized HTTP status constants improves code maintainability

## Next Steps
- Consider creating a shared route segment config file for all API routes
- Review other API routes for potential static export issues
- Document the pattern for future developers
- Implement a UI audit to ensure consistent layout across all pages
