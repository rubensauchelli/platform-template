# Assistant Schema Updates and UI Enhancements
**Date**: February 24, 2025

## Overview
Today we focused on updating the extraction assistant schema to match our new patient data structure and improving the UI to display assistant IDs for better debugging and transparency.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Extraction Assistant Schema Updates
- Updated extraction assistant instructions to match the new patient data schema
- Enhanced instruction quality to improve extraction accuracy and consistency
- Modified response parsing to handle the updated schema structure
- Tested extraction with various document types to ensure compatibility

### 2. UI Enhancements
- Added assistant ID display in the template management UI
- Implemented copy functionality for assistant IDs to facilitate support
- Updated UI components to accommodate the new information
- Improved error messages to be more descriptive when assistant creation fails

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Added schema documentation for the new patient data structure
- Updated developer guides with information about the assistant ID system
- Created troubleshooting section for common assistant-related issues

## Technical Details

The new schema structure follows this pattern:
```typescript
interface PatientData {
  demographics: {
    name: string;
    dob: string;
    gender: string;
    // Additional fields...
  };
  medicalHistory: {
    conditions: Array<{
      name: string;
      diagnosisDate?: string;
      status: 'active' | 'resolved';
    }>;
    // Additional sections...
  };
  // Other top-level sections...
}
```

## Next Steps
- Monitor extraction quality with the new schema
- Collect feedback on the UI changes
- Consider adding more detailed assistant analytics
- Explore options for assistant version tracking
