# Template Management Improvements

## Overview
Today we focused on enhancing the template management system with improved feedback mechanisms and template deletion capabilities. These improvements aim to provide better user feedback and more comprehensive template management options.

## Implementation Details

### Toast Notification System
Implemented a comprehensive toast notification system with the following features:
- Centralized toast positioning for better visibility
- Consistent styling across different notification types
- Clear visual distinction between success/error states
- Organized component structure for maintainability
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Toast Styling Improvements
- Custom color schemes for different notification types:
  - Success: Green theme with subtle background
  - Error: Destructive theme with warning emphasis
  - Info: Blue theme for neutral information
  - Warning: Yellow theme for caution states
- Hover-reveal close buttons
- Semantic color usage for better accessibility
- Consistent spacing and typography

### Template Management Features
Added template deletion capability to the edit page:
- Dedicated delete button in the template edit view
- Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
- Clear visual feedback for destructive actions
- Immediate navigation after successful deletion
- Error handling with user feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Key Decisions
1. Centralized toast configuration in a dedicated component
2. Implemented organized class structure for toast styles
3. Added comprehensive error handling
4. Maintained consistent UI feedback patterns
5. Enhanced template management workflows

### Component Structure
```typescript
const toastClassNames = {
  base: "...",
  title: "...",
  description: "...",
  buttons: {
    action: "...",
    cancel: "...",
    close: "..."
  },
  variants: {
    error: "...",
    success: "...",
    info: "...",
    warning: "..."
  }
}
```

### User Feedback Implementation
- Success notifications for:
  - Template creation
  - Template updates
  - Template deletion
  - Default template changes
- Error notifications for:
  - Failed operations
  - Network issues
  - Validation errors

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements
- Toast grouping for multiple operations
- Custom toast animations
- Interactive toast actions
- Toast persistence options
- Template restoration system

## Lessons Learned
This implementation highlighted several important aspects:
- Importance of consistent user feedback
- Value of confirmation for destructive actions
- Benefits of organized style management
- Impact of proper error handling

## Related Components
- `Toaster`
- `TemplateSelector`
- `EditTemplatePage`
- `AlertDialog`

## Testing Notes
- Verified toast visibility and positioning
- Confirmed deletion workflow
- Tested error scenarios
- Validated toast styling across themes
- Checked responsive behavior
