# Template System Enhancements

## Overview
Today we focused on improving the template management system, particularly around the user experience and loading states. These improvements aim to make the template creation and editing process more intuitive while maintaining system constraints.

## Implementation Details

### Assistant Type Selector
We implemented a new assistant type selector in the template form with the following key features:
- Options for "SCR Extraction" and "CSV Generation"
- Read-only state in edit mode to maintain template integrity
- Interactive tooltip explaining why type can't be changed
- Consistent styling with existing model selector
- Lock icon indicating immutable state

### Loading State Improvements
Developed a new skeleton loading system for template cards:
- Exact dimension and layout matching
- Smooth loading transitions
- Consistent hover states and animations
- Reduced perceived loading time
- Better visual feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Key Decisions
1. Created dedicated `TemplateCardSkeleton` component
2. Implemented secondary color scheme for tooltips
3. Maintained UI component consistency
4. Added comprehensive TypeScript types
5. Built responsive mobile layouts

### Challenges Overcome
The main challenge was creating a natural feel for the assistant type selector in both create and edit modes. Solutions implemented:
- Consistent visual styling with model selector
- Info icon integration in tooltip
- Interactive hover states
- Clear visual indicators for read-only state

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements
- Loading/loaded state transitions
- Error boundary implementation
- Additional assistant types
- Template type migration system

## Lessons Learned
This implementation reinforced several key development principles:
- Importance of clear user feedback
- Impact of UI detail on user experience
- Value of consistent design patterns
- Benefits of component separation

## Related Components
- `TemplateForm`
- `TemplateCard`
- `TemplateCardSkeleton`
- `Tooltip`

## Testing Notes
- Verified skeleton loading behavior
- Confirmed tooltip interactions
- Tested responsive layouts
- Validated type safety
