# Template-Based OpenAI Assistants Integration
**Date**: February 21, 2024

## Key Implementations

### AssistantManager
- Singleton pattern for managing OpenAI assistants
- Efficient caching system to prevent redundant API calls
- Fallback to default assistants when no template is specified
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

```typescript
class AssistantManager {
  private static instance: AssistantManager;
  private assistantCache: Map<string, any> = new Map();
  
  async getAssistantForTemplate(templateId: string | null): Promise<any> {
    // Cache-first approach with fallback to default
    // Includes retry logic and error handling
  }
}
```

### Thread Management
- Proper thread lifecycle management
- Cleanup after extraction completion
- Enhanced error handling
- Clear instruction injection

```typescript
class ThreadManager {
  async createAndProcessThread(fileId: string, assistant: any) {
    // Create thread
    // Process with clear instructions
    // Cleanup after completion
  }
}
```

### Template Integration
- Templates now store OpenAI assistant IDs
- Enhanced instruction building
- Proper validation of responses
- Schema compliance checks

## Technical Decisions

1. **Assistant Reuse**: Instead of creating new assistants for each extraction, we now:
   - Create assistant once during template creation
   - Cache and reuse assistants
   - Update assistant when template is updated

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented retry mechanism
   - Added proper cleanup
   - Enhanced error logging
   - Schema validation

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Assistant caching
   - Efficient thread management
   - Proper resource cleanup

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Add database migration for `openaiAssistantId`
2. [ ] Implement cleanup job for orphaned assistants
3. [ ] Add monitoring for assistant usage
4. [ ] Create admin interface for assistant management

## Notes
- Maintaining backward compatibility with hardcoded assistants
- Need to consider rate limiting for assistant creation
- Consider implementing assistant versioning in future
