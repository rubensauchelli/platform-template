# Client-Side Rendering and Type System Improvements
**Date**: February 25, 2025

## Overview
Today we addressed several issues related to client-side rendering in Next.js and improved our type system to ensure consistency between mock and production environments.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Suspense Boundary Implementation
- Fixed "useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary" errors in template pages
- Refactored the templates page structure to follow Next.js best practices
- Implemented proper loading states for improved user experience
- Resolved static export issues with client components

### 2. Component Structure Improvements
- Separated template pages into three distinct components:
  - Main component that returns a Suspense wrapper
  - Loading component with skeleton UI as the fallback
  - Content component containing the original business logic
- This pattern improves code organization and maintainability

### 3. Type System Enhancements
- Added missing `assistantTypeId` property to template objects in mock data
- Updated mock API client to include required properties
- Ensured type consistency between mock and production environments
- Fixed several TypeScript errors that were causing build warnings

## Technical Implementation

The new component structure follows this pattern:
```tsx
export default function TemplatesPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<TemplatesPageLoading />}>
      <TemplatesPageContent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}

function TemplatesPageLoading() {
  // Skeleton UI implementation
}

function TemplatesPageContent() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()
  // Original component logic
}
```

## Lessons Learned
- Client components using `useSearchParams()` must be wrapped in Suspense boundaries
- Proper component structure with loading states improves both UX and build compatibility
- Type consistency between mock and production data is crucial for testing
- Next.js static export has specific requirements for client components

## Next Steps
- Apply the same component pattern to other pages using client-side data fetching
- Consider creating a reusable pattern for this structure
- Review other areas where Suspense boundaries might be needed
- Improve skeleton UI components for better loading states
